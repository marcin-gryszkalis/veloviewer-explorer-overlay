## TODO
- [x] zoom level < 14
- [ ] color setup support (maybe including transparency option)
- [x] frames
- [ ] auto-refresh of squares cache, with proper locking
- [ ] cache (at least for z=14+ and later for z=11..13)
- [ ] largest square support (clashes with generic cachce, maybe as another overlay???)
- [ ] different color for clusters ("inside" squares)
