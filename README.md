## TODO
- [x] zoom level < 14
- [ ] color setup support (maybe including transparency option), note: 4 colors (bg, frame, max sq. frame, cluster bg)
- [x] frames
- [ ] auto-refresh of squares cache, with proper locking
- [ ] cache (at least for z=14+ and later for z=11..13)
- [x] largest square support (clashes with generic cache)
- [x] different color for clusters ("inside" squares), (note: cache)
- [ ] display boundaries of smaller squares (squadratinhos style, 8x8+)
